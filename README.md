# Work for ECE160 Challenge Problem 2

## Methods?
- Periodicity (auto-correlation)
- Onset detection (evenly spaced, certain std dev of distance between beats)
- Frequency Spectra Analysis (range, repetitiveness)
- kNN Classifier (http://www.nyu.edu/classes/bello/ACA_files/8-classification.pdf)
- RMS values

# What we'll actually build out:
- ZCR
- Spectral centroid
- Spectral flux
- Spectral rolloff?
- Pulse metric?
- Signal energy?
- SVM to tie them all together
