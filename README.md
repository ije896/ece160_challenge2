# Music and Speech Discrimination
###### Work for ECE160, Challenge Problem 2
###### UCSB S18

## Objective
Design an algorithm that will report whether a given audio file contains speech or music audio. Design the algorithm in such a way that the algorithm in such a way that it works on a variety of music and speech signals.

## Methods of Discrimination
- Zero-crossing Rate (ZCR)
- Spectral Centroid (SC)
- Spectral Flux (SF)
- SVM Classifier, trained on the above three features
